Get lost wandering along Paris' cobblestone streets, or grab a croissant and relax on the banks of the Seine for hours. If you're up for a quick daytrip, head about 15 miles southwest of the city center to another must-see attraction: the Palace of Versailles."

To relax, head to Matira Beach for crystal-clear water and soft sand. Although a trip to Bora Bora is very expensive, most travelers say it's worth every penny."
